  <h2>Making the Plane Math Game</h2>
  <p>So, I made a plane math game. It was a simple game. I made it for my digital technology project in year 11.
    I chose to make it a math game because it is easy to generate content for questions, as you can just use a random number generator.
  You can view the project page for the game on this website.</p>
