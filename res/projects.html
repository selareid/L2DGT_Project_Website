          <h2>Implementing NEAT</h2>
          <p>Projects filler. I implemented neat. It very cool thing to implement and it simplifies my code a lot! Having tested a couple of applications using it, I had a very good feeling about it. It works well with nearly all of the tools I have at my disposal. What follows are a few of my earlier applications I tested and how I implemented the neat feature in my applications. I put together a readme file and a GitHub repository where I have listed the code and other documentation related to neat and shown some screenshots. If you want to try the implementation yourself, take a look at the README file and the repository on GitHub.</p>
